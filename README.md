## 🎯 What is LittleInvestors?

**The core insight:** Kids don't learn money from textbooks — they learn it by doing, with parents involved. LittleInvestors bridges that gap.

- 👨‍👩‍ **Parents** send virtual allowances, track progress, and collaborate on financial decisions
- 🤖 **AI coach "Penny"** answers any money question in plain, kid-friendly language

## 📖 What I Built, Who It's For, What I Learned

**What I built:** A mobile-first web app that turns financial education into a collaborative game for families. Instead of boring lectures, kids invest virtual money in real stocks after completing bite-sized lessons — with parents participating by sending virtual allowances.

**Who it's for:** Parents who want to give their children a financial head start, especially in underrepresented communities where formal financial education is lacking. Kids aged 8–16 who learn best by doing.

**Tools used:** Built with Node.js/Express/EJS, styled with pure CSS, AI powered by Google Gemini, analytics via Novus.ai.

**What I learned:** The parent-child dynamic is the product's superpower. The moment you make financial learning a shared experience rather than homework, engagement transforms. Kids love showing their parents their quiz scores and stock picks.

## 🔮 What's Next

- Real stock price API integration (Polygon.io)
- Push notifications for parent deposits
- iMessage integration for family finance chats
- Expanded asset classes (crypto, ETFs, bonds)
- Teacher mode for classrooms

---

## 🧗 Challenges

- **Gemini API for kids**: Getting the AI to consistently give age-appropriate answers required careful system prompting and temperature tuning
- **State without a database**: Using localStorage for all game state required careful design of the data model
- **The parent-child UX split**: Designing one app that serves two very different user types (parent + child) without being confusing for either
