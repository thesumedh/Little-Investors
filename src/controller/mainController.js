Money lets you save up for things you want, pay for services, and plan for the future. There are three main things money does: it\'s a medium of exchange (you use it to buy things), a store of value (you can save it), and a unit of account (you can measure how much something is worth).',

        description: 'Saving is one of the most powerful money habits you can build! When you save a little bit every time you get money, it adds up fast. The trick is to pay yourself first — before you spend anything, put a set amount aside. Think of it like leveling up in a video game — every coin you save gets you closer to your goal. Even saving just $1 a day adds up to $365 in a year. Most financial experts recommend saving at least 20% of any money you receive.',

Wants are things you\'d like to have but can survive without. A great trick is the 24-hour rule — wait one full day before buying something non-essential. If you still want it the next day, it might be worth it! Also, compare prices before buying and look for sales. Smart spenders get more for their money.',

When you invest money, there\'s always a risk you might lose some of it — but there\'s also a chance to gain more! Generally, investments with higher potential returns come with higher risk. Keeping all your money in one place is risky — if that one thing fails, you lose everything. That\'s why smart investors "diversify" — they spread their money across many different investments. A savings account has very low risk but grows slowly. Stocks have higher risk but can grow much faster.',

One of the most powerful concepts in investing is compound growth — your gains themselves start earning gains. Albert Einstein called compound interest "the eighth wonder of the world." Starting early is the most important thing — money invested at age 12 is worth far more than the same money invested at age 22.',
