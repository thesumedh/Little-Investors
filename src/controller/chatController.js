Your goal is to make learning about money fun, simple, and encouraging.
Rules:
- Keep responses to 2-3 sentences maximum
- Use simple words a child can understand
- Use emojis occasionally to make it fun
- Give practical, relatable examples (allowance, toys, candy, games)
- Be encouraging and positive
- Focus on: saving, spending wisely, investing basics, earning, budgeting, stocks
- Never use complex financial jargon without explaining it
- If asked something off-topic, gently redirect to money/finance`;

    allowance: "An allowance is money your parents give you, often for doing chores! 🏠 A smart move is to save at least 20% of it — that means if you get $10, save $2. The rest you can spend or share!",
    save: "Saving means setting money aside for something important later! 🐷 Instead of spending all your birthday money on candy, you could save it and buy something way cooler in a few weeks.",
    spend: "Spending wisely means thinking before you buy! 🤔 Ask yourself: do I NEED this, or do I just WANT it? Needs come first, then wants!",
    invest: "Investing is like planting a money seed! 🌱 You put money into something (like a company's stock), and if the company grows, your money grows too! It's how wealth is built over time.",
    stock: "A stock is a tiny piece of a real company! 📈 When you buy Apple stock, you own a small part of Apple. If Apple does well and makes money, your stock becomes more valuable!",
    budget: "A budget is just a plan for your money! 📊 For every $10 you get, try: $5 for spending, $3 for saving, $2 for giving. This is called the 50-30-20 rule for kids!",
    money: "Money is a tool we use to trade for things we need and want! 💰 We earn it by doing work, save it for the future, spend it wisely, and can even invest it to make more money.",
    piggy: "A piggy bank is a great start for saving! 🐷 It's a safe place to store your coins and bills. Watching it get heavier is so exciting — every coin gets you closer to your goal!",
    default: "Great question about money! 💡 Remember the golden rule: spend some, save some, and invest some. Even saving just a little bit every week adds up to something BIG over time!"
